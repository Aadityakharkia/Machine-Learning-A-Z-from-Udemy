# Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ â€“ Course Repository

This repository contains my projects and code I worked while learning the course. 

This repository contains my personal work, projects, and notes from the Udemy course:  
**[Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R from two Data Science experts](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)**

The course is taught by **Kirill Eremenko** and **Hadelin de Ponteves**, and it provides hands-on implementation of machine learning algorithms in Python.
