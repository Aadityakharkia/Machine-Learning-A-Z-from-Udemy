This repository contains my personal work, projects, and notes from the Udemy course:  
**[Machine Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢: Learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R from two Data Science experts](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)**

The course is taught by **Kirill Eremenko** and **Hadelin de Ponteves**, and it provides hands-on implementation of machine learning algorithms in **both Python and R**.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

- Track my progress through the course
- Practice ML algorithm implementation from scratch
- Organize code and datasets
- Showcase my learning publicly
- Build a GitHub portfolio for future opportunities
